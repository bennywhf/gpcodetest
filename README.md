# gpcodetest

Write a program that reads in records from various input files and then outputs the list with command line options to sort or filter them.

We are looking for the following qualities: simplicity, maintainability, thorough tests, correctness, good engineering practices.

The format of the input files are,

pipe:
First name | Last name | Book Title | Book Publication Date

slash:
Book Publication Date/First name/Last name/Book Title

csv:
Book Title, Last Name, First name, Book Publication Date


Here is the program signature:

usage: books.py [-h] [--filter FILTER] [--year] [--reverse]

Show a list of books, alphabetical ascending by author's last name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --filter FILTER  show a subset of books, looks for the argument as a substring of any of the fields
  --year           sort the books by year, ascending instead of default sort
  --reverse        reverse sort

Here are some sample runs of the program
